# VBA - Stock Market Analysis
Stock Market Data Analytics 

## Background

In this assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

## Instructions

* Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and takes the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Applied conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

### CHALLENGES

1. The solution also returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

2. Made the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script so that it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
